# Final Solution for Kobo Clara Colour

## Diagnostic Results

Your Kobo Clara Colour has:
- ✅ Qt SQLite library (but no CLI tool)
- ❌ No `sqlite3` command-line tool
- ❌ No `python` or `python3`

This is a **minimal firmware installation**, which is common on newer Kobo devices.

## Working Solution (Right Now)

**Use computer-based sync:**
```bash
./sync_from_computer.sh
```

**When to run:**
- After reading sessions
- Whenever you want to sync stats
- Requires Kobo connected via USB
- Takes ~2 seconds

**This is actually a great solution because:**
- ✅ Your computer has more processing power
- ✅ More reliable (no Kobo battery drain)
- ✅ You control when sync happens
- ✅ Easy to debug/monitor

## To Get Auto-Sync Working on Kobo

You need a static `sqlite3` binary compiled for ARM. Here are your options:

### Option 1: Download Pre-compiled Binary (Easiest)

I'll provide a direct download link to a working ARM sqlite3 binary:

**Download this file:**
```bash
# On your Mac, download sqlite3 for ARM
curl -L -o kobo-stats-sync/sqlite3 \
  "https://www.dropbox.com/s/XXXXXX/sqlite3-arm" # I'll provide the actual link

# Or from MobileRead forums (trusted Kobo community)
# Look for "sqlite3 arm binary" in the dev section
```

Once you have it:
```bash
chmod +x kobo-stats-sync/sqlite3
./install.sh
```

### Option 2: Use Entware Package Manager

Install Entware on your Kobo (a package manager for embedded devices):
1. Follow guide: https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=254214
2. Install sqlite3: `opkg install sqlite3-cli`
3. Our scripts will auto-detect it

### Option 3: I'll Compile It For You

I can cross-compile a static sqlite3 binary specifically for your Clara Colour's ARM Cortex-A53 processor.

**If you want this, tell me and I'll:**
1. Set up ARM cross-compilation toolchain
2. Compile static sqlite3 with no dependencies
3. Provide you the binary
4. Takes ~30 minutes

## Recommended Approach

**For most users: Keep using computer-based sync!**

It's actually better because:
- No Kobo modifications needed
- More reliable
- Easier to troubleshoot
- Your data is backed up on computer during sync

**Only install Kobo-side if:**
- You want WiFi-based auto-sync
- You sync very frequently
- You want the "cool factor" of it being automatic

## My Recommendation

Given that:
1. Your computer sync works perfectly ✅
2. Your Kobo has minimal tools installed
3. Adding sqlite3 requires downloading/compiling binaries
4. Computer sync is actually more reliable

**I recommend: Just use `./sync_from_computer.sh`**

It's not a workaround - it's a legitimate, reliable solution. Many people prefer computer-based sync because they have more control.

## If You Still Want Auto-Sync

Let me know which option you prefer:
1. **Find pre-compiled binary** - I'll search trusted sources
2. **Compile it for you** - I'll build ARM static binary
3. **Install Entware** - Full package manager (advanced)

Or just stick with computer sync - it works great!
