# Getting SQLite3 for Your Kobo

## Quick Solution

Since automatic download isn't working perfectly, here's the manual approach:

### Option 1: Copy from Another Kobo Install

If you have KOReader or any other Kobo mods installed, they likely include sqlite3.

**Check your Kobo via USB:**
1. Connect Kobo
2. Look in these locations:
   - `.adds/koreader/libs/`
   - `.adds/kfmon/bin/`
   - `.adds/plato/bin/`
3. If you find `sqlite3`, copy it to our folder:
   ```bash
   cp /Volumes/KOBOeReader/.adds/*/sqlite3 kobo-stats-sync/
   chmod +x kobo-stats-sync/sqlite3
   ./install.sh
   ```

### Option 2: Download Pre-built Binary

Visit one of these trusted sources and download sqlite3 for ARM:

1. **Entware for Kobo** (recommended):
   - https://github.com/koreader/koreader/releases
   - Download latest release
   - Extract `sqlite3` binary from the package

2. **Manual compile** (advanced):
   ```bash
   # Download sqlite amalgamation
   curl -O https://www.sqlite.org/2024/sqlite-autoconf-3460100.tar.gz
   tar xzf sqlite-autoconf-3460100.tar.gz
   cd sqlite-autoconf-3460100
   
   # Cross-compile for ARM (requires arm toolchain)
   ./configure --host=arm-linux-gnueabi --enable-static --disable-dynamic-extensions
   make
   
   # Copy the binary
   cp sqlite3 ../kobo-stats-sync/
   ```

### Option 3: Use My Computer-Based Sync (Current Working Solution)

**This already works!** Just keep using:
```bash
./sync_from_computer.sh
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Works right now
- ✅ No Kobo modifications needed
- ✅ Same result - data syncs to your API

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Requires Kobo to be connected via USB
- ⚠️ Manual process (not automatic)

### Option 4: Wait for Me to Build It

I can build a proper ARM sqlite3 binary for you if you tell me:
1. Your exact Kobo model
2. Your firmware version
3. CPU architecture (likely ARMv7 or ARMv8)

Run this on your computer with Kobo connected:
```bash
./find_sqlite3_on_kobo.sh
```

Then check the log on your Kobo after running "Sync Stats (Verbose)".

## For Now

**The computer-based sync is working perfectly!** Your data is syncing to your API successfully. The only difference is you need to connect via USB instead of it happening automatically on the Kobo.

If you want automatic sync directly from Kobo:
1. Let me know your Kobo model/firmware
2. Or try finding sqlite3 from KOReader/other mods
3. Or I can help you set up SSH access to investigate
