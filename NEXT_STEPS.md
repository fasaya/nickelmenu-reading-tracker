# Next Steps - Kobo Clara Colour (Firmware 4.43.23418)

## Current Status

✅ **Sync working** via computer: `./sync_from_computer.sh`  
❌ **Direct Kobo sync** needs sqlite3 binary

## Action Plan

### Step 1: Install Diagnostic Tool

```bash
./install.sh
```

This will install:
- The sync scripts (currently non-functional on Kobo)
- A diagnostic tool to check what's available on your Kobo
- Updated NickelMenu configuration

### Step 2: Run Diagnostic on Kobo

1. **Eject Kobo safely**
2. **Restart your Kobo** (to load new NickelMenu config)
3. **Tap**: Main Menu → **"Check Sync Tools"**
4. **Read the output** - it will show what tools are available
5. **Connect Kobo via USB**
6. **Check the verbose log**:
   - Open: `/Volumes/KOBOeReader/.adds/kobo-stats-sync/sync.log`
   - Send me the contents

### Step 3: Get sqlite3 Binary

Based on your Kobo Clara Colour, I need to find the right ARM binary. Options:

**Option A: I'll find one for you**
- Send me the diagnostic output
- I'll locate a compatible sqlite3 for Clara Colour
- You'll download and copy it

**Option B: Check your Kobo firmware**
- Kobo Clara Colour (2024) should have Python or sqlite3 somewhere
- The diagnostic will find it
- We might just need to update PATH

**Option C: Build from source**
- I can cross-compile sqlite3 for your specific device
- Guaranteed to work
- Takes more time

### Step 4: Install sqlite3 and Test

Once we have the binary:
```bash
# Place it in the folder
cp sqlite3 kobo-stats-sync/

# Reinstall
./install.sh

# Test sync from Kobo
# Tap: "Sync Reading Stats" on Kobo
```

## For Now: Keep Using Computer Sync

```bash
./sync_from_computer.sh
```

This works perfectly and will continue to work regardless. The only difference is:
- Computer sync: Manual, requires USB
- Kobo sync: Automatic (once we get sqlite3), WiFi-based

## What I Need From You

**Run the diagnostic** and send me:
1. The output from "Check Sync Tools" menu item
2. Or the contents of `/Volumes/KOBOeReader/.adds/kobo-stats-sync/sync.log`

With that info, I'll know exactly what tools your Clara Colour has and can provide the perfect solution!

---

**TL;DR:**
1. Run `./install.sh`
2. Restart Kobo
3. Tap "Check Sync Tools"
4. Send me the output
5. Meanwhile, keep using `./sync_from_computer.sh` (it works!)
